# Learning Design Patterns

A repository dedicated to understanding and implementing Object Oriented Design Patterns in TypeScript. This project uses `Bun.js` as the runtime environment.

Before running the examples, make sure you have `Bun.js` installed on your local machine. If not, you can install it using:

## Running the Examples

```bash
bun ./structural/facade/one/index.ts
```

**or**

```bash
cd ./structural/facade/one
bun index.ts
```
